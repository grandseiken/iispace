;                                              ;
; WiiSPACE was originally a homebrew game I    ;
; developed for the Nintendo Wii in 2009.      ;
; (See here: http://wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiSPACE) ;
;                                              ;
; Now I've ported it to Windows with numerous  ;
; tweaks and improvements. I hope to update    ;
; the original Wii version with these          ;
; improvements some day, but as I no longer    ;
; currently own a Wii it's something that'll   ;
; have to wait.                                ;
;                                              ;
/--< Controls >--------------------------------/
;                                              ;
; Using the mouse and keyboard:                ;
;                                              ;
; Arrow keys / WASD ..... move, navigate menus ;
; LMB / Z ....................... accept, fire ;
; RMB / X ....................... cancel, bomb ;
; Enter / Esc .................... pause, menu ;
;                                              ;
; Using a gamepad:                             ;
;                                              ;
; Make sure to set your gamepad to analog      ;
; mode. The default control scheme should work ;
; with most gamepads (left stick to move ship, ;
; right stick to fire, fire and bombs on the   ;
; other buttons). If it doesn't seem right for ;
; your gamepad, run the included helper        ;
; gamepadconfig.exe to set up a custom scheme  ;
; (or to change the ordering of gamepads).     ;
;                                              ;
/--< Gameplay >--------------------------------/
;                                              ;
; Up to four ships can play at once, though    ;
; you'll need gamepads for more than one (hit  ;
; left/right while `PLAYERS` is selected in    ;
; the main menu).                              ;
;                                              ;
; Defeat each wave of enemies and aim for a    ;
; high score! The green wall-type enemies can  ;
; be dispatched easily once all other foes     ;
; have been dealt with. If the timer runs out  ;
; before you manage to clear a wave, the next  ;
; one will appear, even if you're not ready!   ;
;                                              ;
; Defeat many enemies in a row without taking  ;
; damage to build up your score multiplier!    ;
; You get 2X after destroying 16 enemies, 3X   ;
; after another 32, 4X after another 64, and   ;
; so on. Your multiplier resets to 1X when     ;
; your ship is destroyed.                      ;
;                                              ;
; Every once in a while you'll face a boss -   ;
; perhaps defeating all the bosses will reveal ;
; a secret?                                    ;
;                                              ;
; The game is over when all your extra lives   ;
; are used up.                                 ;
;                                              ;
/--< Powerups >--------------------------------/
;                                              ;
; Fly near a powerup to collect it. There are  ;
; four types.                                  ;
;                                              ;
; Extra life (triangle): adds an extra life.   ;
;                                              ;
; Shield (ring): grants a moment of            ;
; invulnerability the next time you are hit.   ;
;                                              ;
; Bomb (star): can be used later to destroy    ;
; all nearby enemies. Enemies hit by the bomb  ;
; don't increase your score, but do count      ;
; towards your multiplier.                     ;
;                                              ;
; Magic shots (bullet): a limited number of    ;
; shots pierce through your enemies. Line up   ;
; your targets for maximum damage!             ;
;                                              ;
; Each player can only carry one shield or     ;
; bomb, and not both at the same time! Choose  ;
; wisely. Powerups can be left floating around ;
; until you need them, but if there are four   ;
; already you won't get any more until you     ;
; take one.                                    ;
;                                              ;
/--< Replays >---------------------------------/
;                                              ;
; Each game you play is saved in the `replays` ;
; subdirectory, with a filename containing the ;
; date, game mode, player name and final       ;
; score. To view a replay: right-click it,     ;
; choose `Open with...`, and open it with the  ;
; WiiSPACE executable. (If you like you can    ;
; check the box to associate WiiSPACE with     ;
; .wrp files, in which case you'll be able to  ;
; view any replay file simply by double-       ;
; -clicking it.) Dragging replays onto the     ;
; WiiSPACE executable will also work.          ;
;                                              ;
; While viewing a replay, you can press the    ;
; bomb key to increase the playback speed, and ;
; the fire key to slow it down again!          ;
;                                              ;
; UPLOAD YOUR REPLAYS to seiken.co.uk/wiispace ;
; and compete for the best worldwide scores!   ;
;                                              ;
/--< Addenda >---------------------------------/
;                                              ;
; Some settings can be modified in the file    ;
; `wiispace.txt`.                              ;
;                                              ;
; There are some hidden game modes to unlock!  ;
; Try to find them all...                      ;
;                                              ;
; TROUBLESHOOTING:                             ;
; WiiSPACE needs the XInput drivers installed. ;
; This can be obtained stand-alone or as part  ;
; of any recent DirectX installation.          ;
;                                              ;
