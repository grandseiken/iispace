WiiSPACE version 1.1, first released 5 July 2009, and originally distributed at http://wiibrew.org/wiki/WiiSPACE.

This code runs on the Wii as homebrew only and depends on various homebrew libraries and utilities (devkitPPC, libogc, GRRLIB, perhaps more). These are not included. There is no guarantee WiiSPACE will compile or run correctly with more recent versions of these dependencies.
