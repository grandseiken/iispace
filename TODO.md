# Run upgrades

## Shield

### Good ideas
* Increased invulnerability window after hit
* Recharges automatically but max charges limited to 1
* Little thing that circles round you dealing damage (per shield?)
* Can spend shield as a bomb charge
* Taking hit immediately fires bomb charge
* Extra capacity

### Maybe ideas
* Taking hit gives superweapon charge
* Taking hit damages / knocks back enemies (maybe too similar to hit fires bomb?)
* Block one direction with physical shield!
* Charge from kills or maybe something else

## Bomb

* Start off smaller than before

### Good ideas
* Increased radius
* Bomb triggers multiple times
* Remote activation bomb (once to deploy, once to explode)
* Bomb is a black hole
* Bomb is a DoT. Upgrade: DoT can spread
* Bomb hits entire screen but for less damage (leaves large enemies alive mostly)
* Extra capacity

### Maybe ideas
* Increased bomb damage vs bosses
* Bomb is fired a short distance
* Charge from kills
* Multiple grenades
* Thunderball - big slow moving mass that shoots sparks at everything nearby
* Bomb area is a wide line forward and back that sticks around

## Weapon

### Good ideas
* Homing missile shots (with AoE+knockback?)
* Continuous laser shots
* Close-range shotgun with spread + knockback, slower rate of fire
* AoE + knockback on impact
* Cluster bomb on impact
* Bouncing shots
* Extra front shonts
* Back shots
* Each consecutive hit on same enemy does additional damage. And/or consecutive hits on _any_ enemy increase damage
* Hit applies DoT effect. Upgrade: DoT can spread
* Hit applies stun effect
* Projectiles split into 3 at longish range

### Maybe ideas
* Extra damage
* Side shots
* Ignore enemy shields
* Chaingun-esque (even faster but with startup time + overheat)

## Superweapon
* Charge from kills / hits
* What is the default?

### Good ideas
* Penetrating shots, deal many ticks of damage
* Shots stick in enemies, superweapon detonates
* Shoot enemy (homing shot) that later detonates (with your bomb!?) after a short delay
* Single massive damage screen-penetrating sniper shot
* Pizza cutter boomerang and/or rstick-controllable doomcircle
* Bulldozer
* Chain lightning gun that jumps from one enemy to another in patterns that must be exploited
* Flamethrower

### Maybe ideas
* Large number of additional shots
* Large explosions on impact
* Megalaser?
* Hookshot?
* Extra capacity?
* Fire enemies at other enemies
* Deploy autoturret or other traps
* Superweapon refills automatically, but no shields (or limit 1)

## Special ability?
* Escape (short-distance teleport + invulnerability)?
* Knockback nearby enemies
* Pull in nearby enemies
* Invisibility (enemies no longer follow)
* Some sort of drone helper?
* Temporary invulnerability
* Slow time
* Torus warp
* Shield you hold up in a direction (somehow)
* Deploy safety box

Note: many of these hard to do with laggy network.

# Sector conditions (i.e. route steps)
* Aggressive timer for new spawns (should be no timer usually)
* Very narrow sector
* Walls that must be pushed back by shooting
* Constant square walls / etc that fly past and you need to shoot a path through
* Square walls that spiral around the outside and go in
* Zoomed out / bigger area
* Rainbow snake zone
* Progressively more weird secret routes, in different languages/scripts (russian/japanese), minus/glitch level, etc
* Massive black hole
* Dark zone where you can't see much but players + some enemies light things up

# New enemy ideas
* Diagonal walls
* Enemy that shoots lines of bouncing little things like the tractor boss shots
* 6-prong non-destroyable shot shooter that rotates 30 degrees each time
* Enemy that moves slowly until you're close (or gets damaged) then speeds at you
* Enemy that keeps away from players and does something annoying (shoots projectiles)
* Enemy that remains shielded until opening up for powerful attack
* Enemy that shields after being hit and can't be hit for a while
* Enemy made of multiple enemies (how exactly?)
* Pair of enemies with tripwire between
* Suicide bombers
* Area control enemy that leaves acid etc where it goes
* Wall cluster bomb
* Hidden superwall that rotates randomly then emits cross of wall segments
* Wall section with multiple squares that snakes around and can split
* Many new wall types / configuration
* Enemy that shields (or heals) other enemies until killed
* Snakes, oh snakes!
* Big ol snake shooter
* Big ol enemy that spawns new ones when hit and you don't really want to shoot
* Bomb that eats other enemies and detonates?
* More gravity enemies, possibly redesign tractor
* Intelligent follow square that goes to where player is heading
* Fill screen with little enemies that bounce off each other
* Hookshot

## Bosses
* Per-player-count boss balancing with spawns etc
* Super snake

# Currencies / economy
* Large enemies randomly drop bytes/boops
* Bosses drop something (on first kill?)
